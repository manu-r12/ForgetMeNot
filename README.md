# Forget Me Not âœ¨


AR Object Locator helps you save and find real-world objects using AR. If you forget where you placed something, simply scan your surroundings, and the app will guide you to its location. Simple as that.

# ðŸŒŸ Why I Made This

This app is inspired by my Mom(amma) ðŸ‘¸. She would often ask me to place important items somewhere safe, so she could find them later. But the problem? I would always forget where I put themâ€”and that usually led to some well-deserved scolding! To solve this, I created Forget Me Not, an app that ensures youâ€™ll never lose track of your belongings again using AR.
